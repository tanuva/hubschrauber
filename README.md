# Hubschrauber
My first game(tm).

Heavily "inspired" by the '80s game [Choplifter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choplifter). It's not pretty, but it's playable. And could use lots of juice at some point.

This really is about building a working game mechanic, a few levels and menus and make it into a complete package. This way I can pretend I made a game before. :)

For the sake of simplicity I just dropped all the assets into this repository. Thats not the way to do it in the long term, but the sprites are really small. Besides, if I juice this up at some point, I might have learned better ways than Dropbox to handle the binary assets.
